Turnout panels can be placed in 2 mirror-symmetric directions in the field. To distinguish both ends of the turnout panel, a definition of an orientation system with respect to the panel is necessary. The orientation defines, if the panel is oriented in a way or opposite with respect to the direction of the alignment/stationing.
